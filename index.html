        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Interested in pursuing a career in Law practices in a family court of law. Graduated in 2025 from UCR with a Bachelors in Political Science. Currently seeking an internship in laws surrounding Family Court. <br><br>

        Experiences in Lab, retail and international Affairs. While working at Lab for the Botany Department I was able to experience the growth and research of the Oriental Fruit Fly disease with the help of Chandrika Ramadoug I was able to understand the dangers of this disease and how it impacts our citrus crops. While working in this lab my knowledge of lab equipment was expanded and I was able to perform experiments, juice citrus varieties, and have exposure to greenhouse procedures. Working as a retail worker at Vans I was able to maintain and expand my social interactions and be able to understand how retail business allows for social flourishment. As a retail worker, I was able to work in a team which allowed me to grow in my professional career and give an exposure of how to handle situations in which clients or consumers would face disappointment but could be provided resources to a new solution. <br><br>

        My intent is to have a well rounded understanding of business in and outside of the legal field,b by working new and out of the spectrum jobs such as dog sitting or working at Vans I have been able to interact with different clients. In my time as an International Student Staff I was able to work with immigration documents and VISA status for students attending UCR. While the work was rewarding it did give a new insight of the stressfulness that is working with immigration and customs. Many opportunities came with this position such as closely working with the SEVIS record to educate and provide communication between students and our international staff. In my short year of working there I was promoted for the role of a Data Analyst, in this role I worked closely with my International Supervisor Joseph Agudo who allowed me to demonstrate my skills and hold weekly meetings to further guide my work. Overall my work in these fields has provided me with a better understanding of what to expect from the professional world once I graduate in Winter 2025. I will continue to grow my career and my educational career by giving myself better opportunities such as working in Law Firms focused on Family Court and possible immigration work. By pushing myself into a Law Firm I will establish connections with close colleges and build myself a client list where I can and will be able to find work. I plan to pursue a PHD in Political Science and possibly aim for teaching credentials aside from becoming a law/ family court of law attorney. I wish to give students an opportunity to explore what work and jobs can be found in and outside a political science diploma by using my teaching  credentials. I aim to teach the younger generation of their rights.
